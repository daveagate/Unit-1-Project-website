    <p> <strong>Modern Life Is Rubbish</strong> is the second studio album by the English alternative rock band Blur, 
        released in May 1993.<br> Although their debut album Leisure (1991) had been commercially successful, 
        Blur faced a severe media backlash soon after its release, and fell out of public favour. <br>
        After the group returned from an unsuccessful tour of the United States, 
        poorly received live performances and the rising popularity of rival band Suede further diminished Blur's status in the UK. </p>

    <p> <strong>The Stone Roses</strong> The Stone Roses was not an immediate success,
         but grew popular with the band's high-profile concert performances, <br>
         which also helped establish them as fixtures of the Madchester and baggy cultural scenes. <br> 
         The record's critical standing also improved significantly in later years, 
         as many critics voted it highly in polls of the greatest albums</p>
